# Packet Monitor

The Packet Monitor is a diagnostic tool that displays raw Meshtastic packets as they are received from the mesh network. It provides visibility into the low-level packet traffic for debugging and analysis purposes.

::: tip MeshCore Packet Monitor
MeshCore sources have their own equivalent — the **OTA Packet Monitor** accessible from the **Packets** tab in the MeshCore source page. It captures raw OTA frames from the companion's `LogRxData` push (route type, payload type, relay chain, SNR/RSSI, and a full hex dump). See the [MeshCore documentation](/features/meshcore#packet-monitor) for details.
:::

::: tip MQTT Packet Monitor
MQTT sources (`mqtt_broker` and `mqtt_bridge`) also have their own gateway-aware equivalent — see [MQTT sources](#mqtt-sources) below.
:::

::: tip ATAK / CoT Integration
The `ATAK_PLUGIN`, `ATAK_PLUGIN_V2`, and `ATAK_FORWARDER` rows below are one
piece of a larger integration — ATAK contacts also render on MeshMonitor's
maps, and a streaming CoT feed can expose MeshMonitor as an ATAK/WinTAK
network input. See [ATAK / CoT Integration](/features/atak) for the full
picture.

## Accessing the Packet Monitor

The Packet Monitor is available in two locations:

- **Sidebar tab** — Click the Packet Monitor icon in the sidebar for a full-page view
- **Map panel** — The Packet Monitor also appears at the bottom of the Map tab

Both views require the `packetmonitor:read` permission and must be enabled in Settings.

## What the Packet Monitor Shows

::: info Incoming Packets Only
The Packet Monitor displays **only incoming packets** received from the mesh network. It acts as a "radio sniffer" showing what your node hears over the air, not what MeshMonitor transmits.
:::

### Packets That Appear

| Packet Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| TEXT_MESSAGE (1) | Text messages received from other nodes |
| POSITION (3) | GPS position updates from nodes |
| NODEINFO (4) | Node information broadcasts |
| ROUTING (5) | Routing acknowledgments and errors |
| ADMIN (6) | Administrative messages |
| PAXCOUNTER (34) | Paxcounter telemetry |
| TELEMETRY (67) | Device/environment telemetry |
| TRACEROUTE (70) | Traceroute responses |
| NEIGHBORINFO (71) | Neighbor information |
| MESH_BEACON (37) | Firmware 2.8+ periodic beacon advertising a joinable channel (name/preset) — [early preview](/faq#firmware-2-8-early-preview), decoded as `[MeshBeacon: "..."]` |
| ATAK_PLUGIN (72) | ATAK (Team Awareness Kit) plugin packets — decoded as `[ATAK PLI ...]` (position), `[ATAK GeoChat ...]` (chat, also delivered to Messages), `[ATAK detail ...]`, or `[ATAK GeoChat receipt]`; full decoded TAKPacket in the detail view |
| ATAK_PLUGIN_V2 (78) | ATAK V2 (firmware 2.8+ rich CoT, zstd-compressed) — shown as `[ATAK V2 (not decoded), N bytes]`; decoding is a planned follow-up |
| ATAK_FORWARDER (257) | Third-party ATAK Forwarder packets — identified by name, not decoded |

::: tip Signed-packet shield (firmware 2.8 early preview)
Packets carrying a firmware-verified **XEdDSA signature** (Meshtastic's new packet-signing scheme, not yet in an official release) show a small shield icon next to the entry. This only reflects what the connected node itself reported as verified — MeshMonitor doesn't re-verify the signature.
:::

### Packets That Do NOT Appear

The following packets are not logged to the Packet Monitor:

**Outgoing packets sent by MeshMonitor:**
- **Outgoing text messages** - Messages you send via the chat interface
- **Outgoing traceroute requests** - Traceroutes initiated manually or by Auto Traceroute
- **Outgoing position requests** - Position exchange requests
- **Auto-acknowledge responses** - Automated replies sent by MeshMonitor
- **Auto-welcome messages** - Welcome messages sent to new nodes
- **Auto-announcements** - Scheduled announcement messages

**Internal management packets (to/from local node):**
- **ADMIN_APP (6)** - Administrative packets for local device configuration
- **ROUTING_APP (5)** - Routing acknowledgments to/from your connected node

These internal packets are filtered to reduce noise and keep the log focused on actual mesh traffic. ADMIN and ROUTING packets between remote nodes on the mesh are still logged.

This is by design - the Packet Monitor shows mesh network traffic, not MeshMonitor's internal operations or local device management.

## Filtering Packets

Use the packet type dropdown to filter by specific packet types (portnums). The dropdown lists the **full set** of Meshtastic portnums, not just the common ones, so filters like `ADMIN`, `NEIGHBORINFO`, `WAYPOINT`, `ATAK_PLUGIN`, and every other named port are directly selectable.

Common filters include:

- **All Types** - Show all received packets
- **TEXT_MESSAGE** - Show only text messages
- **POSITION** - Show only position updates
- **TELEMETRY** - Show only telemetry data
- **TRACEROUTE** - Show only traceroute responses
- **NODEINFO** - Show only node information packets

Alongside the type dropdown, a **free-text search** field matches against decoded packet content and metadata (node names, node IDs, message text, evidence). The type filter and the search field combine with AND, so you can narrow a single portnum down to only rows that mention a specific node or word.

Every packet monitor view, the main Meshtastic one, the per-source MQTT gateway monitor, and the MeshCore over-the-air monitor, exposes the same **Stop capturing** control at the top so a run does not need to be left open to sample a short window.

::: tip Traceroute Filter
If you filter on TRACEROUTE and see no results, this likely means no traceroute operations have been performed on your mesh recently. Traceroute packets only appear when:
1. A node on your mesh initiates a traceroute
2. The traceroute response is received back

To see traceroute packets, initiate a traceroute from MeshMonitor's Node Details page or from another device on your mesh.
:::

## Packet Information

Each packet entry shows:

- **Timestamp** - When the packet was received
- **From Node** - The sending node's ID and name
- **To Node** - The destination (broadcast or specific node)
- **Channel** - The channel number
- **Port Type** - The Meshtastic portnum/application type
- **SNR/RSSI** - Signal quality metrics
- **Hop Count** - Number of hops the packet traveled
- **Encrypted** - Whether the packet was encrypted
- **Payload Preview** - A summary of the packet contents

## Permissions

### Access Permission

Viewing the Packet Monitor requires the `packetmonitor:read` permission. This is granted by default to all users (including Anonymous). Administrators can revoke it per-user in **Settings > Users**. The Packet Monitor permission is read-only — there is no write mode.

### Packet Filtering by Permission

Once a user has access to the Packet Monitor, the packets they see are filtered based on their other permissions:

| Packet Type | Permission Required |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Encrypted packets | None — always visible (content is unreadable) |
| Decrypted channel packets | `channel_N:read` for the packet's channel (0-7) |
| Direct Messages (TEXT_MESSAGE_APP to a specific node) | `messages:read` (Node Details & DM: Read) |
| Other decrypted packets (POSITION, TELEMETRY, etc.) | `channel_N:read` for the packet's channel |
| Packets with no channel info | Always visible |

Admin users bypass all filtering and see all packets.

::: tip Example
A user with `packetmonitor:read`, `channel_0:read`, and `channel_1:read` (but no `messages:read`) will see:
- All encrypted packets
- Decrypted packets on channels 0 and 1
- Non-DM packets on channels 0 and 1
- **Not** direct message text packets (they need `messages:read` for those)
:::

## MQTT sources

MQTT sources (`mqtt_broker` and `mqtt_bridge`) render a different, gateway-aware
Packet Monitor on the same tab. MQTT's defining trait is that a single mesh packet
can be relayed to the broker by **multiple gateway nodes**, each publishing its own
copy with its own reception time, RSSI, SNR, and hop counts — so the MQTT view is
built around deduplicating those copies back into one packet per entry while still
exposing every gateway's reception details.

### Deduplicated packet list

The main table shows each packet **once**, regardless of how many gateways relayed
it, with a **Gateways** column giving the number of distinct gateways that reported
it (and a Receptions count in the tooltip for the total number of copies received).
Clicking a row opens a detail view listing **every gateway** that received the
packet, with that gateway's specific time, RSSI, SNR, and computed hop count
(`hopStart - hopLimit`) for that reception.

### Gateway filter

Use the **Gateways** dropdown in the filter panel to narrow the list to packets
heard by one or more specific gateways (multi-select, with Select all / Clear
affordances). Gateways are labeled with their resolved node name when the gateway
is present in the node list for the source, otherwise by their hex gateway ID. When
a gateway filter is active, the Gateways column and filter panel note that the
count reflects **only the selected gateways**, not the packet's full gateway set.

### Capture opt-in and retention

Like the MeshCore OTA Packet Monitor, MQTT packet capture is **opt-in** — enable it
from the banner shown when capture is off, or from the filter panel (requires
`settings:write`). Capture is controlled by the `mqtt_packet_log_enabled` setting,
with retention governed by `mqtt_packet_log_max_count` (default 5000 rows — higher
than the other monitors because each row is one gateway reception, not one packet)
and `mqtt_packet_log_max_age_hours` (default 24 hours). Set either retention value
to `0` to disable that cleanup criterion. For example, count `0` with age `24`
keeps any number of rows for 24 hours; setting both to `0` retains packets
indefinitely. Meshtastic and MeshCore packet monitors use the same zero-is-unlimited
semantics for their count and age settings. When both limits are zero, monitor disk
usage because the packet-log tables can grow without bound.

### Encrypted, ignored, and geo-ignored copies are still captured

The MQTT capture records **every copy that reaches ingestion**, not just packets
that were successfully decoded — including copies that could not be decrypted,
copies dropped by geo-ignore filtering, and copies with an unsupported portnum.
These are flagged with an outcome badge (`encrypted`, `ignored`, `geo-ignored`,
`unsupported-portnum`, or `decode-error`) in place of the decoded packet type, so
the monitor stays useful for diagnosing why a packet's contents aren't visible
elsewhere in MeshMonitor.

### `ok_to_mqtt` violation detection

Every Meshtastic packet carries an `ok_to_mqtt` bit (bit 0 of `Data.bitfield`) by which the
originating node signals whether it consents to its traffic being relayed to MQTT. Firmware
only enforces this bit when a gateway relays *someone else's* packet, and it skips the check
entirely whenever the gateway believes its configured broker address is private — a check that
is a plain IP-range test with no awareness of NAT or port forwarding. A gateway reaching its
broker through a LAN-literal address that is *also* port-forwarded to the internet gets
misclassified as private, and will silently relay opted-out traffic to what is effectively a
public broker.

MeshMonitor detects this condition: when a received MQTT packet's `ok_to_mqtt` bit is
**explicitly clear** and the publishing gateway is not the packet's originator, that is a
provable, confirmed violation, and MeshMonitor records it. A packet whose bit cannot be read at
all — because the field was never set, or because the packet is encrypted and MeshMonitor has no
matching channel key — is recorded only as *unknown/suspected*, never as a confirmed violation.

::: info Not necessarily malicious
The overwhelmingly likely cause of a detected violation is the firmware misconfiguration
described above — a gateway whose broker address merely looks private but isn't — not a
deliberate attempt to bypass a node's opt-out. Treat a violation as a configuration issue worth
flagging to the gateway operator, not as evidence of hostile intent.
:::

The other side of that same private-broker check also produces **false positives**, not just
missed detections: when the gateway's broker genuinely *is* private, firmware skips the drop
entirely and relays every packet regardless of the `ok_to_mqtt` bit — by design, not a bug. Every
row MeshMonitor records still looks the same at capture time (a relayed opt-out), so the
**ok_to_mqtt Violations** report annotates each one with what can be determined about the
*observing source's* own configured broker (private / public / unverified) so an expected
private-broker relay isn't mistaken for a confirmed violation. See [Private-broker false
positives](/features/analysis-reports#private-broker-false-positives) for details.

#### Settings

Violation detection is controlled by three settings, all with working defaults out of the box —
no configuration is required to start collecting violation history:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `mqtt_oktomqtt_violation_log_enabled` | ON | Kill switch for recording violations. **Unlike** `mqtt_packet_log_enabled` (opt-in, default off), this setting is **on by default**: set it to `0` to disable violation logging; any other value — including leaving it unset — keeps it on. |
| `mqtt_oktomqtt_violation_retention_days` | `90` | How long a confirmed violation record is retained. |
| `mqtt_oktomqtt_violation_max_count` | `50000` | Maximum number of violation records retained per source before the oldest are trimmed. |

#### Retention is independent of the Packet Monitor

Confirmed violations are stored in their own record set with their own retention policy — 90
days / 50,000 records per source — deliberately independent of the Packet Monitor's much shorter
window (24 hours / 5,000 rows, see [Capture opt-in and retention](#capture-opt-in-and-retention)
above) and of whether MQTT packet capture is enabled at all. Violation history is therefore
retained even on installs that never turn on the MQTT Packet Monitor, and isn't lost when the
packet log trims itself daily.

#### Forward-only detection

Violation detection only covers MQTT traffic received **after** upgrading to a MeshMonitor
version with this feature. There is no backfill: the `ok_to_mqtt` bit was never previously
stored, so there is nothing to retroactively re-evaluate for packets received before the
upgrade — an old row can't be distinguished from a genuinely unreadable one, so guessing would
only produce wrong answers. Expect an empty violation history immediately after upgrading; it
fills in as new MQTT traffic arrives.

#### Viewing violations

A **`violation` badge** appears in the **Type** column of the MQTT Packet Monitor's packet list
when a packet has at least one violating reception. Because the list groups a packet's
per-gateway receptions into a single row, the badge means **at least one** gateway that relayed
the packet violated the bit — it does not mean every gateway did, and it does not say which one.
Open the packet to find out.

The packet detail view is where that attribution happens. It adds an `ok_to_mqtt` row to the
packet summary and an `ok_to_mqtt` column to the per-gateway receptions table, showing one of
four states for each individual reception:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **violation** | This gateway relayed the packet even though the sender did not opt in. The only state rendered as a highlighted badge. |
| **allowed** | The sender set the bit; relaying the packet was permitted. |
| **opted out** | The sender did not opt in, but no third-party relay of this reception could be established, so it isn't a violation. This can happen for several reasons — it is not simply "the sender published its own packet." |
| **unknown** | The bit could not be read: the payload wasn't decryptable, or the packet was captured before violation detection existed. |

Only `violation` renders as a badge; `allowed`, `opted out`, and `unknown` are shown as plain text
in the detail view. This is deliberate — `unknown` is the majority state on any channel
MeshMonitor has no key for, and badging it would drown out the real signal. For the same reason,
the packet list shows the badge only for confirmed violations; the other three states are visible
only in the detail view.

#### Capture must be on to see the badge

Violation *recording* (described above) is on by default, but the badge and per-gateway column
read from the MQTT Packet Monitor's own capture log (see
[Capture opt-in and retention](#capture-opt-in-and-retention)), which is **opt-in and off by
default**. On a default install, violations are being recorded in the background while the badge
never appears, because there is no captured packet list for it to attach to.

When capture is off, the Packet Monitor says so explicitly — in both the capture-disabled banner
and the empty state. **Absence of badges does not mean absence of violations.** Turn capture on
to see per-packet, per-gateway violation badges.

#### Reviewing violation history without packet capture

Violation *recording* runs independently of the Packet Monitor (see above), and there's a
dedicated place to review it: the **ok_to_mqtt Violations** report under **Analysis & Reports**.
It aggregates confirmed violations across every MQTT source you can read — no need to turn on
MQTT packet capture on any of them just to see gateway violation history. See
[ok_to_mqtt Violations](/features/analysis-reports#ok-to-mqtt-violations) for details.

## Use Cases

The Packet Monitor is useful for:

- **Debugging connectivity issues** - See if packets are being received
- **Analyzing mesh traffic patterns** - Understand what types of traffic flow through your node
- **Verifying encryption** - Check which packets are encrypted vs unencrypted
- **Signal quality analysis** - Monitor SNR/RSSI values over time
- **Troubleshooting packet delivery** - Verify packets are reaching your node
